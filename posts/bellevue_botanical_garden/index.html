It’s beautifully sunny.\nThe trail itself seemed pretty isolated although there was a school and field for kids around but it might have just been due to lots of trees around. After 0.2miles we entered the gardens which had just begun to blossom and it was really enjoyable. Many flowers were emitting pleasant aromas!\nWe wandered around until we finally landed at the visitor center - guess we went in the more backward route haha. Got to see the Japanese themed garden (the pond was mostly dry ironically), talked about Buddhism and origins of Buddha as we wandered about. Next stop was the perennials and the yao garden which had year round green plants such as conifers and daffodils and other plants. Spotted hummingbirds and woodpeckers and a variant of sparrow called Spotted Towhee near the bushes - tried to take a video but our iphones were not equipped for it unfortunately.\nThe visitor center had lots of flower themed earrings, books on gardening and birds, lots of butterfly themed hairclips and other cute items and with humungous will power, we managed not to give in to the temptations! We saw some sculptures and lots of walking paths and history of the place. It was a cow shed previously (1936 with first human settlement and later converted to a public garden). With 53 acres it contained a lot of wildlife and beauty. And, the red cedar trees could live upto 1000 years! 10 times the lifespan of a human. Plants are amazing. There was also the Gunnera tinctoria which had spiky shaped leaves. The tall oregon grape plant is home to lot of birds with its delicious fruits and yellow flowers.\nThere was a suspension bridge as well - that many kids and adults alike were delighted by! Got to bounce around and feel like we were on an adventure as we saw the creek below with shallow water. After an hour and a half, we headed back, went on a different trail and had to do a loopback to finally get back to our car. Overall, a pretty enjoyable day! Felt like we acquired relaxed energy and got rid of the afternoon sluggish tendancies with this outing.\nPhotos Lightning shaped tree spotted by Anurag - we were really surprised by its shape Beautiful aromatic flowers Me with another gigantic tree The park ","wordCount":"412","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://sin317.github.io/bent_down_flowers.jpeg","datePublished":"2025-03-01T19:50:42-08:00","dateModified":"2025-03-01T19:50:42-08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Khushi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://sin317.github.io/posts/bellevue_botanical_garden/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Khushi's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://sin317.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://sin317.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Khushi's Blog (Alt + H)">Khushi's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://sin317.github.io/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://sin317.github.io/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://sin317.github.io/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://sin317.github.io/portfolio/ title=Me><span>Me</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://sin317.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://sin317.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Bellevue botanical garden</h1><div class=post-description>Exploration of the gardens!</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-03-01 19:50:42 -0800 PST'>March 1, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;412 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Khushi&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/sin317.github.io/content/posts/bellevue_botanical_garden.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#wilburton-park-trail aria-label="Wilburton Park Trail">Wilburton Park Trail</a></li><li><a href=#photos aria-label=Photos>Photos</a><ul><ul><ul><li><a href=#lightning-shaped-tree-spotted-by-anurag---we-were-really-surprised-by-its-shape aria-label="Lightning shaped tree spotted by Anurag - we were really surprised by its shape">Lightning shaped tree spotted by Anurag - we were really surprised by its shape</a></li><li><a href=#beautiful-aromatic-flowers aria-label="Beautiful aromatic flowers">Beautiful aromatic flowers</a></li><li><a href=#me-with-another-gigantic-tree aria-label="Me with another gigantic tree">Me with another gigantic tree</a></li><li><a href=#the-park aria-label="The park">The park</a></li></ul></ul></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=wilburton-park-trail>Wilburton Park Trail<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#wilburton-park-trail>#</a></h2><p>Friends and I set off to an afternoon outing because Spring is finally here in Washington!
