At the heart of Rust\u0026rsquo;s design are ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which play a crucial role in how data structures are implemented and used. This blog explores Rust\u0026rsquo;s ownership model and common data structures with illustrative code examples.\nCommon Data Structures Vectors Vectors are dynamic arrays that grow and shrink in size. They\u0026rsquo;re owned collections, meaning their data is managed by the vector itself.\nExample: Using Vectors\nfn main() { let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3]; v.push(4); // Add an element println!(\u0026#34;{:?}\u0026#34;, v); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] // Iterating over a vector for i in \u0026amp;v { println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, i); } } HashMap Key Value store\nExample:\nuse std::collections::HashMap; fn main() { let mut scores = HashMap::new(); scores.insert(\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, 50); scores.insert(\u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, 30); // Accessing values if let Some(score) = scores.get(\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;) { println!(\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#39;s score: {}\u0026#34;, score); } // Iterating over the HashMap for (key, value) in \u0026amp;scores { println!(\u0026#34;{}: {}\u0026#34;, key, value); } } The Ownership Model in Rust Rust\u0026rsquo;s ownership model has three core rules:\nEach value in Rust has a variable called its owner. A value can have only one owner at a time. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped. Example: Ownership and Scope fn main() { let s1 = String::from(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); // s1 owns the String let s2 = s1; // Ownership of the String is moved to s2 // println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, s1); // Error: s1 is no longer valid println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, s2); // Output: hello } Borrowing You can have multiple immutable borrows or one mutable borrow, but not both at the same time. A borrow (immutable or mutable) must always be valid for its scope. By enforcing these rules, Rust prevents data races and ensures memory safety at compile time. 1. Mutable Borrow: A mutable borrow gives you the ability to modify the borrowed value, but it enforces exclusivity. Only one mutable borrow is allowed at a time, and no immutable borrows can exist simultaneously.\nExample:\nfn main() { let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3]; { let v_mut = \u0026amp;mut v; // Mutable borrow v_mut.push(4); // Modifying the vector } // v_mut goes out of scope here println!(\u0026#34;{:?}\u0026#34;, v); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] } 2. Reference (Immutable Borrow): An immutable borrow means you can read the value without taking ownership, but you cannot modify it. Multiple immutable borrows are allowed simultaneously because they don\u0026rsquo;t change the data.\nExample:\nfn main() { let s = String::from(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); let r1 = \u0026amp;s; // Immutable borrow let r2 = \u0026amp;s; // Another immutable borrow println!(\u0026#34;{} and {}\u0026#34;, r1, r2); // Both r1 and r2 can be used } Borrow conflict example: fn main() { let mut s = String::from(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); let r1 = \u0026amp;s; // Immutable borrow // let r2 = \u0026amp;mut s; // Error: Cannot have a mutable borrow while immutable borrows exist println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, r1); } ","permalink":"https://sin317.github.io/posts/rust_intro/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"understanding-rust-data-structures-and-ownership\"\u003eUnderstanding Rust Data Structures and Ownership\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust is a modern systems programming language that guarantees memory safety and concurrency without a garbage collector.
