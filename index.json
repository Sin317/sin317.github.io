[{"content":"The festival On April 6th, 2025, many are celebrating a significant and joyous Hindu festival: Ramanavami. This auspicious occasion marks the birth of Lord Rama, the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu and a revered figure embodying righteousness, courage, and virtue.\nRamanavami falls on the ninth day of the Chaitra month in the Hindu lunar calendar, during the Shukla Paksha (waxing phase of the moon). It is a time for devotees to reflect on the life and teachings of Lord Rama, whose epic tale, the Ramayana, continues to inspire millions with its profound lessons on dharma (righteous conduct), family values, and the triumph of good over evil.\nThe Significance of Lord Rama Lord Rama is revered as \u0026ldquo;Maryada Purushottam,\u0026rdquo; the ideal man. His life exemplifies the highest standards of moral and ethical conduct. He is admired for his unwavering adherence to dharma, his compassion, his courage in the face of adversity, his devotion to his family, and his just rule as a king.\nThe teachings derived from the Ramayana continue to hold relevance in today\u0026rsquo;s world. They emphasize the importance of truth, righteousness, loyalty, and the power of good to overcome evil. Ramanavami serves as a reminder of these timeless values and encourages devotees to imbibe them in their own lives.\nFood Many make panaka, I made it with muskmelon by making jaggery water with caradamom seeds and adding grinded muskmelon with lemon.\nAs we observe Ramanavami today, let us reflect on the noble ideals that Lord Rama embodied and strive to incorporate them into our lives. May this festival bring peace, prosperity, and righteousness to all.

That\u0026rsquo;s exactly where I found myself last weekend when I decided to take the plunge with Equine Escapes, a family owned horse ranch nestled in the WA.\nKelly, the owner arrived at the meetup point and I was blown away by the carriage - it was a huge one with 6 horses. We also saw lots of other riders with their horses. It was a sunny day so everyone wanted to enjoy it seems!\nMeeting the Herd The six horses that would guide our journey through the wilderness each possessed distinct personalities that quickly became apparent:\nDakota, the undisputed alpha male of the herd, carried himself with quiet confidence and stoic dignity. Diego radiated excitement, his curious eyes constantly scanning the surroundings, seemingly thrilled about the adventure ahead. Jack, my eventual companion, was an Arabian male with a gentle temperament and an insatiable appetite for any patch of grass within reach. Teddy, a gigantic Belgian horse, commanded attention with his majestic presence and powerful frame. Trinity, aptly named \u0026ldquo;the princess,\u0026rdquo; carried herself with elegance as the second-in-command of this equine community. Tinker, a sweet-natured female, moved with a mellow grace that instantly put newcomers at ease. It took about 40 minutes to stretch out the horses and get them into the bridle and saddle a few of them up.\nI was paired with Jack, positioned third in our single-file formation behind Diego and Dakota. My initial challenge became immediately apparent—Jack\u0026rsquo;s irresistible urge to sample every patch of grass along the trail required gentle but firm guidance. Through this unexpected test, I gradually mastered what I came to think of as the \u0026ldquo;gentle approach to discipline,\u0026rdquo; learning to communicate with my four-legged partner through subtle cues.\nTo my surprise, the ride proved remarkably comfortable. Despite warnings about soreness that typically plagues first-time riders, my improving posture seemed to align naturally with Jack\u0026rsquo;s trotting rhythm along the trail.\nOur path wound through a lush forest tapestry—dense trees, vibrant undergrowth, and occasional steep inclines that showcased the horses\u0026rsquo; sure-footedness. Midway through our journey, we paused for photographs, capturing moments that would later translate the majesty of both the wilderness and our equine companions.\nHorse communication 101 The journey also offered an unexpected education in equine communication. The occasional loud flatulence and rhythmic breathing were, as I learned, the horses\u0026rsquo; way of signaling their well-being to the rest of the herd. Our guide explained that continuous huffing would indicate distress—a vital piece of knowledge for any aspiring rider.\nPerhaps most fascinating was discovering how responsive these intelligent animals were to human positioning. A gentle squeeze of the calf against their sides, accompanied by a soft verbal cue, would set them in motion—a dance of mutual understanding between species.\nThe hour-long adventure passed with surprising swiftness, leaving me with muscles that recognized their new experience but also with a profound appreciation for these magnificent animals and the wilderness we had traversed together.\n","permalink":"https://sin317.github.io/posts/horseride/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"my-first-adventure-with-horse-riding\"\u003eMy First Adventure with Horse Riding\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping into the world of horseback riding can feel intimidating, especially if your experience with horses extends no further than petting one at a county fair.

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where UI updates dynamically without requiring full-page reloads. Developed and maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook), React has become one of the most widely used front-end frameworks due to its declarative and component-based nature.\nIn this blog post, we’ll dive into how React works, how it renders UI updates efficiently, and what makes it such a powerful tool for modern web development.\nWhy Use React? Before diving into how React works, let\u0026rsquo;s look at some reasons why developers prefer it:\nComponent-Based Architecture: React applications are built using reusable components, making the code modular and maintainable. Virtual DOM for Efficient Rendering: React updates only the necessary parts of the UI instead of re-rendering the entire page. Unidirectional Data Flow: React enforces a one-way data flow, making it easier to manage application state. Rich Ecosystem and Community Support: React has extensive third-party libraries, tools, and a large community to help developers. Cross-Platform Development: React Native allows developers to build mobile applications using React. Now, let’s explore how React works under the hood.\nHow React Works Components and JSX At its core, React is all about components. A React application is composed of multiple components that represent different parts of the UI. Components can be either functional (simpler and based on functions) or class-based (stateful and based on ES6 classes). However, with the introduction of hooks, functional components have become more prevalent.\nReact uses JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript:\nfunction Welcome(props) { return \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello, {props.name}!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;; } This JSX gets compiled into regular JavaScript using Babel before being rendered to the browser.\nVirtual DOM and Reconciliation React uses a Virtual DOM (VDOM) to optimize UI updates. The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM, allowing React to make efficient updates without modifying the real DOM directly.\nHere’s how React updates the UI efficiently:\nWhen a component’s state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree. It then compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a diffing algorithm. React determines the minimal set of changes required and updates only those parts of the real DOM (a process called reconciliation). This approach significantly improves performance because modifying the real DOM is slow, whereas updating the Virtual DOM is much faster.\nReact Rendering Lifecycle React follows a lifecycle for rendering components. Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for managing state updates effectively.\nMounting (Initial Rendering) When a component is first rendered, React performs the following steps:\nCalls the constructor (for class components) to initialize state. Calls render() to generate the Virtual DOM. Updates the real DOM and invokes lifecycle methods like componentDidMount() (for class components) or useEffect(() =\u0026gt; {...}, []) (for functional components). Updating (Re-rendering) When a component’s state or props change, React performs an update cycle:\nReact detects the change and re-renders the Virtual DOM. It compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one. It updates only the changed parts of the real DOM efficiently. Lifecycle methods like componentDidUpdate() or useEffect() (with dependencies) run after updates. Unmounting (Cleanup) When a component is removed from the DOM, React cleans up any lingering effects using componentWillUnmount() (for class components) or useEffect(() =\u0026gt; {...}, []) return function (for functional components).\nReact State and Props State and props are crucial concepts in React:\nState: A component’s internal data that can change over time (e.g., user input, API responses). Props: Read-only data passed from a parent component to a child component. Example of using state:\nimport React, { useState } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Count: {count}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button onClick={() =\u0026gt; setCount(count + 1)}\u0026gt;Increment\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } Here, useState(0) initializes the count state, and setCount updates it.\nReact Hooks Hooks allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features previously available only in class components. Some important hooks include:\nuseState(): Manages component state. useEffect(): Handles side effects like API calls. useContext(): Accesses global state without prop drilling. useRef(): References DOM elements or persists values across renders. Example of useEffect() for fetching data:\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; function DataFetcher() { const [data, setData] = useState(null); useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { fetch(\u0026#39;https://api.example.com/data\u0026#39;) .then(response =\u0026gt; response.json()) .then(data =\u0026gt; setData(data)); }, []); return \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : \u0026#39;Loading...\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;; } Handling Events in React React events work similarly to native DOM events but use camelCase (e.g., onClick instead of onclick). Event handlers are passed as functions.\nExample:\nfunction Button() { const handleClick = () =\u0026gt; { alert(\u0026#39;Button clicked!\u0026#39;); }; return \u0026lt;button onClick={handleClick}\u0026gt;Click Me\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt;; } Conditional Rendering React allows rendering components conditionally using JavaScript expressions:\nfunction Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) { return isLoggedIn ? \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Welcome back!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; : \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Please log in.\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;; } Lists and Keys When rendering lists, React requires a unique key prop to optimize updates.\nfunction List() { const items = [\u0026#39;Apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Cherry\u0026#39;]; return ( \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; {items.map((item, index) =\u0026gt; ( \u0026lt;li key={index}\u0026gt;{item}\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; ))} \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; ); } Conclusion React’s efficiency comes from its Virtual DOM, reconciliation process, and component-based structure. Understanding how React renders UI updates helps developers write better, more optimized applications.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re new to React, start with small projects and experiment with state, props, and hooks. With practice, you’ll quickly grasp the power of React and be able to build dynamic, scalable applications.\n","permalink":"https://sin317.github.io/posts/intro_to_react/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction-to-react-understanding-how-it-works-and-renders\"\u003eIntroduction to React: Understanding How It Works and Renders\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-react\"\u003eWhat is React?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReact is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where UI updates dynamically without requiring full-page reloads.

At the heart of Rust\u0026rsquo;s design are ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which play a crucial role in how data structures are implemented and used. This blog explores Rust\u0026rsquo;s ownership model and common data structures with illustrative code examples.\nCommon Data Structures Vectors Vectors are dynamic arrays that grow and shrink in size. They\u0026rsquo;re owned collections, meaning their data is managed by the vector itself.\nExample: Using Vectors\nfn main() { let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3]; v.push(4); // Add an element println!(\u0026#34;{:?}\u0026#34;, v); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] // Iterating over a vector for i in \u0026amp;v { println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, i); } } HashMap Key Value store\nExample:\nuse std::collections::HashMap; fn main() { let mut scores = HashMap::new(); scores.insert(\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, 50); scores.insert(\u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, 30); // Accessing values if let Some(score) = scores.get(\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;) { println!(\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#39;s score: {}\u0026#34;, score); } // Iterating over the HashMap for (key, value) in \u0026amp;scores { println!(\u0026#34;{}: {}\u0026#34;, key, value); } } The Ownership Model in Rust Rust\u0026rsquo;s ownership model has three core rules:\nEach value in Rust has a variable called its owner. A value can have only one owner at a time. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped. Example: Ownership and Scope fn main() { let s1 = String::from(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); // s1 owns the String let s2 = s1; // Ownership of the String is moved to s2 // println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, s1); // Error: s1 is no longer valid println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, s2); // Output: hello } Borrowing You can have multiple immutable borrows or one mutable borrow, but not both at the same time. A borrow (immutable or mutable) must always be valid for its scope. By enforcing these rules, Rust prevents data races and ensures memory safety at compile time. 1. Mutable Borrow: A mutable borrow gives you the ability to modify the borrowed value, but it enforces exclusivity. Only one mutable borrow is allowed at a time, and no immutable borrows can exist simultaneously.\nExample:\nfn main() { let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3]; { let v_mut = \u0026amp;mut v; // Mutable borrow v_mut.push(4); // Modifying the vector } // v_mut goes out of scope here println!(\u0026#34;{:?}\u0026#34;, v); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] } 2. Reference (Immutable Borrow): An immutable borrow means you can read the value without taking ownership, but you cannot modify it. Multiple immutable borrows are allowed simultaneously because they don\u0026rsquo;t change the data.\nExample:\nfn main() { let s = String::from(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); let r1 = \u0026amp;s; // Immutable borrow let r2 = \u0026amp;s; // Another immutable borrow println!(\u0026#34;{} and {}\u0026#34;, r1, r2); // Both r1 and r2 can be used } Borrow conflict example: fn main() { let mut s = String::from(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); let r1 = \u0026amp;s; // Immutable borrow // let r2 = \u0026amp;mut s; // Error: Cannot have a mutable borrow while immutable borrows exist println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, r1); } ","permalink":"https://sin317.github.io/posts/rust_intro/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"understanding-rust-data-structures-and-ownership\"\u003eUnderstanding Rust Data Structures and Ownership\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRust is a modern systems programming language that guarantees memory safety and concurrency without a garbage collector.
